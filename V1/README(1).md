# V1

Our first ever iteration of the build. Extremely weird and unreliable, but it got the ball rolling.

## How it works

When weight it placed on a specified area, it deforms a plate of aluminium that has a strain gauge attached to it. When the metal bends, it either increases or decreases the resistance across the strain gauge. We can place this strain gauge inside of a wheatstone bridge to get a voltage difference. 

A problem that occured was that we could not amplify the signal by very much, so for just a small change in voltage, a great deal or force was needed. This is why the build is basically just a huge lever. The weight has mechanical advantage and has an easier time flexing the plate.

However, this configuration makes measurements extremely susceptible to small vibrations or small changes in where the weight is placed.

## Cool Stuff
Used newtons method to approximate the weight based on a polynomial model.
