Code for V1 build of Stuy Oly's Detector Builidng event
Microcontroller: Atmega328p (Arduino)
Half bridge used to measure force (Big lever was used)
INA125 instrumentation amplifier

V2 is the latest version of the code

Misc:
This was a crazy thing that we managed to pull off. On the bus to cornell we had no code or data at all.
We forgot the design log and got ranked 9th :(
Overall it was really fun to pull that all-nighter and get this thing to kind of work :)
The coolest thing IMO is using newtons method to approximate for the 6 degree polynomial function we found for our data.
